This app takes a list of headlines from The Onion, builds a Markov Chain, and generates new article titles. Example:

__"McDonald’s Now Offering Sainthood To Anyone In Character Costume"__

This comes from the following real articles:

* "__McDonald’s Now Offering__ Bereavement Prices"
* "Desperate Catholic Church __Now Offering Sainthood To Anyone__ Who Regularly Attends Weekly Mass"
* "Report: Most Parents Willing To Entrust Children __To Anyone In Character Costume__"
