This app takes a list of headlines from The Onion, builds a Markov Chain, and generates new article titles. Example:

_"McDonald’s Now Offering Sainthood To Anyone In Character Costume"_

This comes from the following real articles:

* "_McDonald’s Now Offering_ Bereavement Prices"
* "Desperate Catholic Church _Now Offering Sainthood To Anyone_ Who Regularly Attends Weekly Mass"
* "Report: Most Parents Willing To Entrust Children _To Anyone In Character Costume_"
